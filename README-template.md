### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

Different design methods and responsive design with pure html & css, it broaden my mind about front-end technologies.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

body{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
    height: 100vh;
    
}
.container{
    padding: 20px;
    margin-top: 15% auto;
    margin: 0;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    color: white;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
    align-items: center;
    max-width: 400px;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
.button-container{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 10px;
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 400px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
    border-radius: 5px;

}
.button{
    padding: 10px;
    text-align: center;
    display: block;
    text-decoration: none;
    color: white;
    flex-direction: column;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}
it teaach me how to fit components in different resolutions.
